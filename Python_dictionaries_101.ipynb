    "# Defining a Dictionary\n",
    "Dictionaries are Python’s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:\n",
    "```\n",
    "d = {\n",
    "    <key>: <value>,\n",
    "    <key>: <value>,\n",
    "      .\n",
    "      .\n",
    "      .\n",
    "    <key>: <value>\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following defines a dictionary that maps a location to the name of its corresponding Major League Baseball team:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> MLB_team = {\n",
    "...     'Colorado' : 'Rockies',\n",
    "...     'Boston'   : 'Red Sox',\n",

    "...     'Seattle'  : 'Mariners'\n",
    "... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also construct a dictionary with the built-in dict() function. The argument to dict() should be a sequence of key-value pairs. A list of tuples works well for this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "d = dict([\n",
    "    (<key>, <value>),\n",

    "...     Seattle='Mariners'\n",
    "... )\n",
